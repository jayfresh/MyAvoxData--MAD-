			<p>My Avox Data, also known as MAD, is a service launched by <a href="http://www.avox.info" target="_blank">Avox</a> that allows subscribers to access comprehensive information for business entities including registered address, industry classifications, immediate and ultimate parent. </p>
			<p>We've made available a sample of over 2,500 of these broad records for you to view for free - please register for a guest account <a href="/">on the homepage</a> to get access.</p>
			<p>The next step is to extend the management of business entity data into the hands of the community. This will enable you to add more records, more attributes, comments, audit histories - the lot. As a subscriber you will also have the ability to extract and download selected records in a variety of formats.</p>
			<p>We believe flexibility is paramount. There are various ways in which you can interact with the business entity data that we've published. You will be able to retrieve the entity data using your own applications. More information for developers can be found on the <a href="/pages/api">application programming interface (API)</a> section. </p>
			<p>My Avox Data users can purchase an annual subscription which includes access to over 250,000 records.</p>

			<p>We've set up a blog at <a href="http://avoxinfo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://avoxinfo.blogspot.com/</a> where we hope you will offer your ideas, comments and criticisms. This is the beginning of an open standard in business entity data. It needs your active participation. We welcome and encourage involvement from other vendors, regardless of whether or not they are our competitors.</p>

			<p>Over the course of the past few years, Avox has processed hundreds of thousands of business entity data records for numerous global clients. On <a href="http://wiki-data.com" target="_blank">wiki-data.com</a>, you will find basic information about a number of those business entities including their legal name, country of incorporation, primary operational location details which comprise country, state/province/region (for US, Canadian and Australian entities) and city as well as the <a href="http://www.avox.info" target="_blank">Avox</a> identifier (we refer to it as the AVID).</p>
			<p>We are putting these "skinny" records on this website for restriction-free usage. The only thing we ask in return is for you to inform us when you find something that you believe is incorrect. For example, you may not be able to locate a business with a specific name in the country where we indicated it operates or is registered. We will work with you to establish the correct information. By doing so, you will help improve and maintain the quality and timeliness of this shared data asset making it more reliable and therefore more useful for everyone (by the way, the most frequent cause of incorrect data is because the entity has gone through a name or address change. It may also be that you have the incorrect information from a source that you have assumed was always correct in the past).</p>
			<p>Note that there may be minor discrepancies resulting from application of acronyms or punctuation which you don't need to tell us about unless these discrepancies don't comply with our data standards. A short explanation of those standards is shown when you hover your cursor over the heading of each column in the search results.</p>-->

			<p><a href="http://www.avox.info" target="_blank">Avox</a>, a majority-owned subsidiary of <a href="http://dtcc.com/" target="_blank">The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation</a>, validates, corrects, enriches and maintains business entity reference data. This includes data such as corporate hierarchies, registered address information, industry sector codes and company identifiers.</p>
			<p>The company was founded several years ago in cooperation with several financial institutions that required a more efficient mechanism for improving data quality and timeliness.</p>
			<p>The <a href="http://www.avox.info" target="_blank">Avox</a> operational model is unique in the industry. Its success stems from the continuous enhancement and customization programs in place for each client. Financial institutions participating in <a href="http://www.avox.info" target="_blank">Avox</a> form a Community that collectively addresses poor client, issuer and counterparty data quality. The Community participants, which include some of the largest banks and asset managers in the world, both contribute and subscribe to a shared pool of data, processes and resources.</p>
