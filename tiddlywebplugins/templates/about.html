			<p>We've set up a blogging forum for wiki-data at <a href="http://avoxinfo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://avoxinfo.blogspot.com/</a> where we hope you will offer your ideas, comments and criticisms. This is the beginning of an open standard in business entity data. It needs your active participation. We welcome and encourage involvement from other vendors, regardless of whether or not they are our competitors.</p>

			<p>Over the course of the past few years, Avox has processed hundreds of thousands of business entity data records for numerous global clients. On <a href="http://wiki-data.com" target="_blank">wiki-data.com</a>, you will find basic information about a number of those business entities including their legal name, country of incorporation, primary operational location details which comprise country, state/province/region (for US, Canadian and Australian entities) and city as well as the <a href="http://www.avox.info" target="_blank">Avox</a> identifier (we refer to it as the AVID).</p>
			<p>We are putting these "skinny" records on this website for restriction-free usage. The only thing we ask in return is for you to inform us when you find something that you believe is incorrect. For example, you may not be able to locate a business with a specific name in the country where we indicated it operates or is registered. We will work with you to establish the correct information. By doing so, you will help improve and maintain the quality and timeliness of this shared data asset making it more reliable and therefore more useful for everyone (by the way, the most frequent cause of incorrect data is because the entity has gone through a name or address change. It may also be that you have the incorrect information from a source that you have assumed was always correct in the past).</p>
			<p>Note that there may be minor discrepancies resulting from application of acronyms or punctuation which you don't need to tell us about unless these discrepancies don't comply with our data standards. A short explanation of those standards is shown when you hover your cursor over the heading of each column in the search results.</p>-->
